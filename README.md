  Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹
</h1>

My name is Eugenie, following a reconversion I have just graduated from **the professional title web and mobile web developer** (level 5). 

You will find on my profile different projects developed during this last year. And also the project I worked on during my internship. 

I'm currently preparing **the professional title Application Developer Designer** (level 6) with the school O'clock. 
I'm in a work-study contract with the company **Open Sezam**, which develops a sass solution for strong authentication without passwords.
